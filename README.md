# AWS S3 Static Website Deployment Lab

## Overview
This project documents my experience deploying a static website to **Amazon S3** using the **AWS CLI** from an **Amazon EC2** instance.  
The lab simulates creating a website for a Caf√© & Bakery and creating an update script for repeatable deployments.

By the end of this lab, I achieved the following:
- Ran AWS CLI commands that interact with Amazon S3.
- Created and configured an S3 bucket for website hosting.
- Uploaded static website files to the bucket.
- Enabled S3 static website hosting.
- Created a script to automate website updates.

### **Task 3: Extract Static Website Files**
Prepared the website files for deployment to S3 by extracting the lab-provided archive.
